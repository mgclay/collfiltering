# collfiltering
Example of collaborative filtering

To run this program, you must have Python and libraries pandas, seaborn, and sklearn installed. 

This does not implement a book recommendation system; it is a rudimentary example of using collaborative filtering to generate a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens-100K dataset.

Built using Python 3.10.6 on Windows 11.
